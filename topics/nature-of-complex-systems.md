# Nature of complex systems

## Concepts

* sharp-end vs. blunt-end
* practitioner actions as gambles
* coping with complexity
* robust yet fragile
* drift
* strange loops
* dark debt
* well-adapted, under-adapted, over-adapted
* decompensation, working at cross-purposes, getting stuck in outdated behaviors
